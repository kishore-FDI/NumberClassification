# Number Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using various machine learning models within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The implemented models include:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Running the Code

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook (`number_classification_project.ipynb`) to your local machine.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.
3. Upload the notebook to your Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Execute the code cells step by step.

Ensure that the required datasets are available in your Jupyter Notebook environment. If using the MNIST dataset, it can be loaded directly within the notebook.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Each model is trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated on a separate test set. The training process includes preprocessing steps, such as normalizing pixel values and one-hot encoding labels.

## Results

The performance metrics, including accuracy and possibly other relevant metrics depending on the model, are displayed for each trained model. Additionally, visualizations of predictions for a few test images are provided.

## Conclusion

The results and insights gained from this project can be used to compare the effectiveness of different machine learning models for the task of number classification within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Feel free to experiment with hyperparameters, model architectures, or other datasets to further explore and improve the classification task.
